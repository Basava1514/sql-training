1. Create folder 'Test' in your home directory
--> mkdir Test

2. Create below files
  - employeelist
  - skillset
--> cat >employeelist
    cat >skillset

3. Create folder Test2 in home directory
  - a) create symbolink and hard link for skillset file 
    --> ln -s skillset softskillset 
        ln skillset hskillset 

  - b) delete skillset file and check if hardlink and symbolic link file exists
    --> rm skillset
        ls -l

  - c) explain the difference b/n symbolic and hard links
    -->Symbolic link creates some temp file which though doesn't hold any memory that file will redirect to the source file its link provided to a source file through the other name.
       Hard link can be defined as a file or link thatvdirectly links to the souce file or it can also be said as a copy of sourcefile because even though the sourcefile is deleted the hard link holds all the information same as it's sourcefile.

4. Provide read and write permission to 'user2' group
   test if user2 group users can access the file
--> Assuming we are in user2 directory /home/user2/
    chmod g+r employeelist (This gives read permission to group)
    chmod g+w employeelist (This gives write permission to group)

5. Revoke write permission from user2 group and test the access again
--> chmod g-w employeelist 

6. Grant write permission for others and test it 
--> chmod o+w employeelist

7. Revoke write permission for others and test again
--> chmod o-w employeelist

8. Change the group of employeelist file to 'user3'
   test if user3 group have access
--> chgrp user3 employeelist

9. Change ownership of the file to user5 and test
--> chown employeelist user5

10. check how many employees are there  (hint: use wc command)
--> wc -l employeelist

1) Create file “File1”
--> cat >File1

2) Append 2 more lines to the same file
--> cat >>File2
    Line2
    Line3
    ctrl-d

3) Create File2 with few lines
--> cat >File2
    Line1
    Line2
    ctrl-d

4) Display the contents of both File1 and File2
--> cat File1 File2

5) Concatenate both File1 & 2
--> cat File1 File2 >& file3

6) Send the above output to File3
--> cat File1 File2 >& file3 1>File3

7) Read File1,File2,File3… File5 . Observe the output
-->cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File4 File5

8) Redirect the errors of the above command to “errorlog”
--> cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File4 File5 2>errorfile

9) Concatenate name File1 to 5 and store it in File 10. if any errors, log them in the same file 
--> cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File4 File5 >&File10

10) Copy File1 to File6. Add the errors to “errorlog”
--> cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File4 File5 File6 >&errorlog
